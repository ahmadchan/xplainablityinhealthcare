This project introduces a trustworthy medical code recommender system, leveraging a knowledge gragh based AI framework. Designed to enhance accuracy, transparency, and trustworthiness in medical coding, the system addresses inefficiencies in the healthcare revenue cycle. By integrating human expertise into AI processes, the recommender system reduces manual coding efforts while improving precision and efficiency. It uses advanced data integration pipelines, knowledge graphs, and AI models fine-tuned for medical contexts. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b1b3cfd-f513-45b0-98ae-d24ad15e1fe5)
