include obesity, alcohol, smoking, kidney or endocrine diseases, diabetes mellitus, and family history. postmenopause is also frequently associated with arterial hypertension.    signaling description: the hypertension risk related to postmenopause is due to rapid reduction of estrogen levels, which has a direct effect on blood vessel functions. estrogens influence the transcription of a number of genes. once activated by estrogen, the esr1 is translocated into the nucleus where it interacts with transcription factors including ncoa1/2/3 and ep300 to form a transcription complex to induce the expression of downstream target genes. in addition, rapid non-genomic effects are mediated by esr1 and gper. the loss of estrogens contributes to endothelial dysfunction and results in arterial hypertension. endothelial dysfunction is typically characterized by a reduction in nitric oxide (no) levels. estradiol quickly stimulates no production by increasing intracellular ca2+ which activates nos3 and in the long-term by upregulating the transcription of nos3. both acute and chronic effects of estradiol on no promote vasodilation. cav1 and cav3 are the primary structural proteins of caveolae, which are vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane that represent specialized membrane signaling organelles. they are the preferential site of esr1 signaling complexes in endothelial cells. activated esr1 co-localizes with cav1/3 and activates nos3. once activated by estradiol, membrane-bound esr1 activates pik3ca via pik3r1.    outcome effects: pik3ca, through pip3 and pdpk1, activates akt1, which phosphorylates and activates nos3 and creb1, which in turn bind the nuclear esr1 transcription complex. in addition, gper, via gnaq, stimulates plcb1 and phosphatidyl-inositol-calcium second messenger system resulting in the release of ca2+ into the cytoplasm from the endoplasmic reticulum. ca2+ binds the multifunctional binding messenger protein, calmodulin, which activates nos3. cav3 inhibits adcy, which activates nos3 via pka. nuclear esr1 transcription complex promotes the expression of ptgis, ptgs2, and ptgs1, which catalyze the synthesis of prostaglandin involved in vasodilation and regulation of platelet function. in addition, nuclear esr1 transcription complex promotes the expression of blood clotting regulators such as pros1, thbd, and procr. furthermore, esr1 and gper activate map kinases cascade via src/shc1 and leads to the activation of il6, il8, ccl2, and vegfa which are involved in the mediation of vascularization.

[chmo]@@@@@nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) is an effect whereby magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field absorb and re-emit electromagnetic (em) energy. certain atomic nuclei, and in particular hydrogen, have a magnetic moment or spin; i.e., they have an intrinsic magnetisation, like a bar magnet. the spin aligns along the strong magnetic field, but can be changed to a misaligned excited state in response to applied radio frequency (rf) pulses of electromagnetic radiation. when the excited hydrogen nuclei relax to their aligned state, they emit rf radiation, which can be measured and displayed as a spectrum. the nature of the emitted radiation depends on the environment of each hydrogen nucleus, and if one nucleus is excited, it will influence the absorption and emission of radiation by other nuclei that lie close to it. it is consequently possible, by an ingenious elaboration of the basic nmr technique known as two-dimensional nmr, to distinguish the signals from hydrogen nuclei in different amino acid residues and to identify and measure the small shifts in these signals that occur when these hydrogen nuclei lie close enough to interact: the size of such a shift reveals the distance between the interacting pair of hydrogen atoms. in this way nmr can give information about the distances between the parts of the interacting molecule. nmr provides information about interacting atoms thereby permitting to obtain information about macromolecular structure and molecular interactions.@@@@@<ncicp:complexdefinition xmlns:ncicp=""http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/xml/owl/evs/complexproperties.xsd#""><ncicp:def-definition>an absorption spectroscopic technique which uses nmr (nuclear magnetic resonance) to basically measure the frequency (resonant frequency) of vibrating nuclei (having non-zero spin) of a given type in the presence of a magnetic field.  when placed in a magnetic field, nuclei that have non-zero spins absorb frequency characteristic of the isotope.  the frequency (resonant frequency), the energy of absorption, and the intensity of measured nmr signal are proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. nuclei of different isotopes in a substance resonate at different frequencies depending upon the local molecular geometry (bond lengths, bond angles, bonded atoms, etc.) and the local magnetic field at each nucleus.  nuclei of the same type can have slightly different resonant frequencies depending on the chemical environment.  the difference between the frequency of the measured signal (nmr signal) from nuclei (in a molecule) in one sample and that (reference resonant frequency) from the same type of nuclei in a reference substance is used to obtain structural information of the molecule in a sample, or the chemical composition of the sample.  this technique has applications in the study of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of matter.</ncicp:def-definition><ncicp:definition_review_date>100610</ncicp:definition_review_date><ncicp:def-source>npo</ncicp:def-source><ncicp:attr>http://www.answers.com/topic/nmr-spectroscopy (june 10, 2010), http://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/nmr/inside.htm (june 10, 2010)</ncicp:attr><ncicp:definition_reviewer_name>dennis thomas</ncicp:definition_reviewer_name></ncicp:complexdefinition>@@@@@a radiology test that based on the absorption of electromagnetic radiation of a specific frequency by an atomic nucleus in the presence of a strong, static, magnetic field, used in medicine to monitor tissue metabolism and to distinguish between normal and abnormal cells.@@@@@spectroscopic method of measuring the characteristic energy absorbed and reemitted or dispersed by nuclei that are subjected to a static magnetic field and simultaneously irradiated with radiofrequency radiation; measurement of the magnetic moment of elementary particles such as atomic nuclei, protons or electrons.@@@@@an assay used to identify the chemical structure of a compound or biological macromolecule using an nmr instrument.@@@@@an nuclear magnetic resonance result is a result of an nuclear magnetic resonance assay.

(source : nci)@@@@@a type of spectroscopy where the energy states of spin-active nuclei placed in a static magnetic field are interrogated by inducing transitions between the states via radio frequency irradiation. [chmo]@@@@@nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) is used to analyze protein-small molecule interactions. this binding interaction is commonly monitored by the chemical shift of the compound.  with this technique, both the binding interaction and bound compounds can be detected, which allows pools of 5-100 compounds to be tested for binding.@@@@@nmr spectroscopy on small- to medium-size biological macromolecules. this is often used for structural investigation of proteins and nucleic acids, and often involves more than one isotope.@@@@@data depicting nmr spectra from a sample.@@@@@the measurement of the velocity of a moving object or medium using an nmr signal.@@@@@the process of determining the quantity of a sample by adding measured increments of a titrant until the end-point is reached. the titration is monitored by observing the changes in sucessive nmr spectra, taken after each addition of titrant.@@@@@depending on the local chemical environment, different protons in a molecule resonate at slightly different frequencies. since this frequency shift is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, it is converted into a field-independent dimensionless value known as the chemical shift. the chemical shift is reported as a relative measure from some reference resonance frequency. (for the nuclei1h, 13c, and 29si, tms (tetramethylsilane) is commonly used as a reference.) this difference between the frequency of the signal and the frequency of the reference is divided by frequency of the reference signal to give the chemical shift. the frequency shifts are extremely small in comparison to the fundamental nmr frequency. a typical frequency shift might be 100 hz, compared to a fundamental nmr frequency of 100 mhz, so the chemical shift is generally expressed in parts per million (ppm). 

by understanding different chemical environments, the chemical shift can be used to obtain some structural information about the molecule in a sample. the conversion of the raw data to this information is called assigning the spectrum.

chronic increase in blood pressure, which may lead to a variety of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and renal disease. hypertension risk factors include obesity, alcohol, smoking, kidney or endocrine diseases, diabetes mellitus, and family history. postmenopause is also frequently associated with arterial hypertension.    signaling description: the hypertension risk related to postmenopause is due to rapid reduction of estrogen levels, which has a direct effect on blood vessel functions. estrogens influence the transcription of a number of genes. once activated by estrogen, the esr1 is translocated into the nucleus where it interacts with transcription factors including ncoa1/2/3 and ep300 to form a transcription complex to induce the expression of downstream target genes. in addition, rapid non-genomic effects are mediated by esr1 and gper. the loss of estrogens contributes to endothelial dysfunction and results in arterial hypertension. endothelial dysfunction is typically characterized by a reduction in nitric oxide (no) levels. estradiol quickly stimulates no production by increasing intracellular ca2+ which activates nos3 and in the long-term by upregulating the transcription of nos3. both acute and chronic effects of estradiol on no promote vasodilation. cav1 and cav3 are the primary structural proteins of caveolae, which are vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane that represent specialized membrane signaling organelles. they are the preferential site of esr1 signaling complexes in endothelial cells. activated esr1 co-localizes with cav1/3 and activates nos3. once activated by estradiol, membrane-bound esr1 activates pik3ca via pik3r1.    outcome effects: pik3ca, through pip3 and pdpk1, activates akt1, which phosphorylates and activates nos3 and creb1, which in turn bind the nuclear esr1 transcription complex. in addition, gper, via gnaq, stimulates plcb1 and phosphatidyl-inositol-calcium second messenger system resulting in the release of ca2+ into the cytoplasm from the endoplasmic reticulum. ca2+ binds the multifunctional binding messenger protein, calmodulin, which activates nos3. cav3 inhibits adcy, which activates nos3 via pka. nuclear esr1 transcription complex promotes the expression of ptgis, ptgs2, and ptgs1, which catalyze the synthesis of prostaglandin involved in vasodilation and regulation of platelet function. in addition, nuclear esr1 transcription complex promotes the expression of blood clotting regulators such as pros1, thbd, and procr. furthermore, esr1 and gper activate map kinases cascade via src/shc1 and leads to the activation of il6, il8, ccl2, and vegfa which are involved in the mediation of vascularization.

http://www.ob-ultrasound.net/doppler_a.html@@@@@pulsed doppler ultrasound is a technique for measuring the velocity of blood in a small sample volume. ... the received signal is gated so that the time elapsed between the transmission of the pulse and the opening of the gate determines the depth of the velocity measurement, i.e., the position of the sample volume. the doppler signal is processed by a fourier spectrum analyser, which performs a fourier transform on the doppler signal at intervals of approximately 10 ms. the amplitudes of the resulting spectra are encoded as brightnesses and these are plotted as a function of time (horizontal axis) and frequency shift (vertical axis) to provide a two-dimensional spectral display. with this technique, a range of blood velocities in the sample volume will produce a corresponding range of frequency shifts on the spectral display. the incorporation of pulsed doppler and b-mode imaging into one instrument allows the position of the doppler sample volume to be known and enables the measurement of the doppler angle.

f = fo   (c + v   cos(q))/ (c - v   cos(q))

where:

c is the acoustic velocity in blood, i.e., 1.54 
f o is the transmitted frequency;
q is the doppler angle;
v is the velocity of the blood.
...
there are three main techniques for making doppler ultrasound velocity measurements of blood flow; continuous wave doppler, pulsed doppler, and color doppler. pulsed doppler can be referred to as pulsed doppler, spectral doppler, or duplex doppler.

loss of cell membrane integrity and the release of the cellular contents into the surrounding extracellular space. this usually occurs under conditions of extreme damage such as ischemia or trauma when apoptosis fails to occur.    signaling description: an important consequence of necrotic cell death is the loss of plasma membrane integrity, thereby allowing the escape of intracellular material from the cell. mechanical damage of membranes leads to the release of free radicals of hydrogen, oxygen, and others. superoxide radical is the major initial free radical species, which can be converted into other reactive species. in the mitochondria, superoxide radical is generated by the capture of electrons in the mitochondrial electron transport chain escaping from the electron transport chain by molecular oxygen (o2). superoxide can be rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) by superoxide dismutases (sod1), which can be reused to generate superoxide radicals. h2o2 diffuses freely across cellular membranes and can interact with iron (fe2+) in the fenton reaction in the lysosomes since they are rich in free fe2+ and lack h2o2-detoxifying enzymes. in the presence of transition metals such as fe2+, h2o2 can be converted into hydroxyl radicals that are highly reactive and can cause damage to lipids, proteins, and dna. nitric oxide (no) is a reactive radical produced from arginine by nitric oxide synthase (nos). no has a very short half-life and can react with superoxide to form peroxynitrite.    outcome effects: the targets of ros are proteins and the polyunsaturated fatty acid residues in the membrane phospholipids which are extremely sensitive to oxidation. free radicals lead to lipid peroxidation and the destruction of cellular membranes. oxidative stress directly leads to damage of cellular macromolecules including dna, proteins, and lipids. furthermore, extensive dna damage during necrosis causes hyperactivation of parp1 and leads to necrotic cell death. when dna damage is moderate, parp1 participates in dna repair processes. however, excessive parp1 activation is involved in catalyzing the hydrolysis of nad into nicotinamide and poly(adpribose) (par) which leads to atp depletion, irreversible cellular energy failure, and necrotic cell death. parp1-mediated cell death requires the activation of ripk1 and traf2. necrosis can be classified as either stochastic or programmed (necroptosis). necroptosis has now been established as a regulated necrotic cell death pathway controlled by tnf, ripk1 and ripk3 kinases. necrosis causes lipid peroxidation of intracellular membranes of endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and mitochondria and leads to the release of calcium (ca2+) and proteolytic enzymes into the cytoplasm where they further digest cellular content and expose it to extracellular space. the molecules that are released after necrotic cell death and may cause inflammation are called damage-associated molecular patterns (damps). there are also extracellular damps which are released after the degradation of extracellular matrix caused by injury. for example, fragments of hyaluronan, heparin sulfate, and biglycan are generated as a result of proteolysis catalyzed either by enzymes released from dying cells or by proteases activated to promote tissue repair and remodeling.    highlighted proteins:

chronic increase in blood pressure, which may lead to a variety of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and renal disease. hypertension risk factors include obesity, alcohol, smoking, kidney or endocrine diseases, diabetes mellitus, and family history. postmenopause is also frequently associated with arterial hypertension.    signaling description: the hypertension risk related to postmenopause is due to rapid reduction of estrogen levels, which has a direct effect on blood vessel functions. estrogens influence the transcription of a number of genes. once activated by estrogen, the esr1 is translocated into the nucleus where it interacts with transcription factors including ncoa1/2/3 and ep300 to form a transcription complex to induce the expression of downstream target genes. in addition, rapid non-genomic effects are mediated by esr1 and gper. the loss of estrogens contributes to endothelial dysfunction and results in arterial hypertension. endothelial dysfunction is typically characterized by a reduction in nitric oxide (no) levels. estradiol quickly stimulates no production by increasing intracellular ca2+ which activates nos3 and in the long-term by upregulating the transcription of nos3. both acute and chronic effects of estradiol on no promote vasodilation. cav1 and cav3 are the primary structural proteins of caveolae, which are vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane that represent specialized membrane signaling organelles. they are the preferential site of esr1 signaling complexes in endothelial cells. activated esr1 co-localizes with cav1/3 and activates nos3. once activated by estradiol, membrane-bound esr1 activates pik3ca via pik3r1.    outcome effects: pik3ca, through pip3 and pdpk1, activates akt1, which phosphorylates and activates nos3 and creb1, which in turn bind the nuclear esr1 transcription complex. in addition, gper, via gnaq, stimulates plcb1 and phosphatidyl-inositol-calcium second messenger system resulting in the release of ca2+ into the cytoplasm from the endoplasmic reticulum. ca2+ binds the multifunctional binding messenger protein, calmodulin, which activates nos3. cav3 inhibits adcy, which activates nos3 via pka. nuclear esr1 transcription complex promotes the expression of ptgis, ptgs2, and ptgs1, which catalyze the synthesis of prostaglandin involved in vasodilation and regulation of platelet function. in addition, nuclear esr1 transcription complex promotes the expression of blood clotting regulators such as pros1, thbd, and procr. furthermore, esr1 and gper activate map kinases cascade via src/shc1 and leads to the activation of il6, il8, ccl2, and vegfa which are involved in the mediation of vascularization.

chronic increase in blood pressure, which may lead to a variety of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and renal disease. hypertension risk factors include obesity, alcohol, smoking, kidney or endocrine diseases, diabetes mellitus, and family history. postmenopause is also frequently associated with arterial hypertension.    signaling description: the hypertension risk related to postmenopause is due to rapid reduction of estrogen levels, which has a direct effect on blood vessel functions. estrogens influence the transcription of a number of genes. once activated by estrogen, the esr1 is translocated into the nucleus where it interacts with transcription factors including ncoa1/2/3 and ep300 to form a transcription complex to induce the expression of downstream target genes. in addition, rapid non-genomic effects are mediated by esr1 and gper. the loss of estrogens contributes to endothelial dysfunction and results in arterial hypertension. endothelial dysfunction is typically characterized by a reduction in nitric oxide (no) levels. estradiol quickly stimulates no production by increasing intracellular ca2+ which activates nos3 and in the long-term by upregulating the transcription of nos3. both acute and chronic effects of estradiol on no promote vasodilation. cav1 and cav3 are the primary structural proteins of caveolae, which are vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane that represent specialized membrane signaling organelles. they are the preferential site of esr1 signaling complexes in endothelial cells. activated esr1 co-localizes with cav1/3 and activates nos3. once activated by estradiol, membrane-bound esr1 activates pik3ca via pik3r1.    outcome effects: pik3ca, through pip3 and pdpk1, activates akt1, which phosphorylates and activates nos3 and creb1, which in turn bind the nuclear esr1 transcription complex. in addition, gper, via gnaq, stimulates plcb1 and phosphatidyl-inositol-calcium second messenger system resulting in the release of ca2+ into the cytoplasm from the endoplasmic reticulum. ca2+ binds the multifunctional binding messenger protein, calmodulin, which activates nos3. cav3 inhibits adcy, which activates nos3 via pka. nuclear esr1 transcription complex promotes the expression of ptgis, ptgs2, and ptgs1, which catalyze the synthesis of prostaglandin involved in vasodilation and regulation of platelet function. in addition, nuclear esr1 transcription complex promotes the expression of blood clotting regulators such as pros1, thbd, and procr. furthermore, esr1 and gper activate map kinases cascade via src/shc1 and leads to the activation of il6, il8, ccl2, and vegfa which are involved in the mediation of vascularization.

e. coli and related bacteria constitute about 0.1% of gut flora,[7] and fecal-oral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination.[8][9] the bacterium can also be grown easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. e. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism,[citation needed] and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant dna.

located at the rear of the abdominal cavity in the retroperitoneum, the kidneys receive blood from the paired renal arteries, and drain into the paired renal veins. each kidney excretes urine into a ureter, itself a paired structure that empties into the urinary bladder.

chronic increase in blood pressure, which may lead to a variety of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and renal disease. hypertension risk factors include obesity, alcohol, smoking, kidney or endocrine diseases, diabetes mellitus, and family history. postmenopause is also frequently associated with arterial hypertension.    signaling description: the hypertension risk related to postmenopause is due to rapid reduction of estrogen levels, which has a direct effect on blood vessel functions. estrogens influence the transcription of a number of genes. once activated by estrogen, the esr1 is translocated into the nucleus where it interacts with transcription factors including ncoa1/2/3 and ep300 to form a transcription complex to induce the expression of downstream target genes. in addition, rapid non-genomic effects are mediated by esr1 and gper. the loss of estrogens contributes to endothelial dysfunction and results in arterial hypertension. endothelial dysfunction is typically characterized by a reduction in nitric oxide (no) levels. estradiol quickly stimulates no production by increasing intracellular ca2+ which activates nos3 and in the long-term by upregulating the transcription of nos3. both acute and chronic effects of estradiol on no promote vasodilation. cav1 and cav3 are the primary structural proteins of caveolae, which are vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane that represent specialized membrane signaling organelles. they are the preferential site of esr1 signaling complexes in endothelial cells. activated esr1 co-localizes with cav1/3 and activates nos3. once activated by estradiol, membrane-bound esr1 activates pik3ca via pik3r1.    outcome effects: pik3ca, through pip3 and pdpk1, activates akt1, which phosphorylates and activates nos3 and creb1, which in turn bind the nuclear esr1 transcription complex. in addition, gper, via gnaq, stimulates plcb1 and phosphatidyl-inositol-calcium second messenger system resulting in the release of ca2+ into the cytoplasm from the endoplasmic reticulum. ca2+ binds the multifunctional binding messenger protein, calmodulin, which activates nos3. cav3 inhibits adcy, which activates nos3 via pka. nuclear esr1 transcription complex promotes the expression of ptgis, ptgs2, and ptgs1, which catalyze the synthesis of prostaglandin involved in vasodilation and regulation of platelet function. in addition, nuclear esr1 transcription complex promotes the expression of blood clotting regulators such as pros1, thbd, and procr. furthermore, esr1 and gper activate map kinases cascade via src/shc1 and leads to the activation of il6, il8, ccl2, and vegfa which are involved in the mediation of vascularization.

fourquintillionsixtyonequadrillionfourhundredandtwentytrillioneightybillionfivemilliononehundredandfortyone	R39.13	Splitting of urinary stream	urinary jet interruption	this is the typical method of fast swimming in cephalopods. during jet propulsion, water is taken into the mantle cavity by expansion of the mantle. water enters laterally at the sides of the head, passes over the collar, over the gills and leaves through the funnel when the mantle contracts. mantle contraction causes water pressure in the mantle cavity to increase and forces the collar against the mantle wall. the collar, therefore, acts as a one-way valve to prevents water from leaving by the same route that it entered. the ventral wall of the funnel presses against the mantle during mantle contraction and seals that opening as well. water, therefore, is forced through the funnel and out the funnel orifice. the force provided by the water leaving the funnel can be directed by movements of the funnel. typically the water leaves the funnel anteriorly causing the cephalopod to jet backward (e.g. when escaping a predator) or the funnel is directed posteriorly causing the water to leave posteriorly and the animal to jet anteriorly (e.g. when pouncing on a prey). some species are able to glide via this method.@@@@@the time span of a disruption in an event.@@@@@a jet on the windward side of a mountain barrier, blowing parallel to the barrier.@@@@@the region of a jet stream axis with the greatest winds.@@@@@a river.@@@@@weakly luminous upward propagating discharges, blue in color, emanating from the tops of thunderstorms.@@@@@rapid flow of oral contrast through a stenosed region of the esophagus with proximal dilatation, resembling the wake of a jet. suggests esophageal web.@@@@@the injection of solutions into the skin by compressed air devices so that only the solution pierces the skin.@@@@@nocturnal cold-air jet flowing out of the mouth of a valley or canyon as it opens onto a plain.@@@@@a geyser in the lower geyser basin of yellowstone national park in the united states.@@@@@the protein-coding gene jet (jetlag) located on the chromosome 2l mapped at 25b4-25b4.@@@@@dense stream of contrast from ureteral orifice crosses bladder obliquely to opposite wall on an intravenous pyelogram. may suggest inflammatory process or may be normal.@@@@@a time interval during which there is a temporary cessation of something.@@@@@relatively strong winds concentrated within a narrow stream in the atmosphere.@@@@@	injection (jet)@@@@@bancaud 1981 interrupt of ongo activ speaking-->speech is slow or interrupt walking-->stand transfix eating--> food stop@@@@@jet lag syndrome@@@@@jet airplane, device@@@@@interruption duration@@@@@cg8873@@@@@jet aeroplane@@@@@jet ski, device@@@@@phonatory interruption, function@@@@@fbxl15@@@@@jet airplane, device (physical object)@@@@@ureteral jet@@@@@jet injection@@@@@dimethylaminophenyl phosphonate@@@@@interruption@@@@@jet ski, device (physical object)@@@@@injection, jet@@@@@time zone syndrome@@@@@jet dyeing@@@@@bladder jet@@@@@interrupt@@@@@ce regimen@@@@@jet washer (physical object)@@@@@jet@@@@@jet injections@@@@@dmelcg8873@@@@@bancaud 1981 interruption of ongoing activity speaking-->speech is slowed or interrupted walking-->stands transfixed eating--> food stops@@@@@ec protocol@@@@@jet sign@@@@@phonatory interruption, function (observable entity)@@@@@jet printer@@@@@interruptionduration@@@@@jet phenomenon@@@@@interrupted@@@@@injections, jet@@@@@jet lag (finding)@@@@@intrp@@@@@jet lesion (morphologic abnormality)@@@@@ce protocol 2@@@@@espohageal jet@@@@@

e. coli and related bacteria constitute about 0.1% of gut flora,[7] and fecal-oral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination.[8][9] the bacterium can also be grown easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. e. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism,[citation needed] and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant dna.

testicular torsion are similar to the infection epididymitis.@@@@@testicular torsion is when the spermatic cord to a testicle twists, cutting off the blood supply. the most common symptom is acute testicular pain.@@@@@less than expected testicular size.@@@@@an abnormal growth in the testis.@@@@@a painful sensation in the testis.@@@@@bleeding originating from the testis.@@@@@accumulation of serous fluid between the layers of membrane (tunica vaginalis) covering the testis in the scrotum.@@@@@a malignant germ cell tumor arising from the testis. it represents the rarest of the testicular germ cell tumors. histologically it is characterized by the presence of syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts.@@@@@an abnormal bulge or lump in a testis. a testicular mass has a long differential diagnosis including testicular torsion, epididymitis, acute orchitis, strangulated hernia and testicular cancer.@@@@@a primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm that affects the testis. representative examples include seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, sarcoma, leukemia, and lymphoma.@@@@@the word mass is often used interchangeably with tumor, which derives from the latin word tumor that originally meant any form of swelling. a small mass may be asymptomatic. larger masses may cause pain if they press on a nerve or organ, or may lead to other manifestations depending on their location. in general, the finding of a mass will lead to a workup to determine the nature of the mass. more precise hpo terms should be used if possible. this term should be used only if the etiology has not yet been clarified.@@@@@a non-seminomatous germ cell tumor arising from the testis. it is characterized by the presence of various tissues which correspond to the different germinal layers (endoderm,

this entity is a specific course-dependent process. this process can constitute the course of renal fibrosis.@@@@@of or pertaining to the kidney.@@@@@note that 'renal medulla' is not synonymous with 'medullary region of kidney'. the former is composed of kidney pyramids only, while the latter covers kidney pyramids and renal columns, which are histologically different.@@@@@the inner portion of the kidney consisting of the renal pyramids.@@@@@a reduction in the level of performance of the kidneys in areas of function comprising the concentration of urine, removal of wastes, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, homeostasis of blood pressure, and calcium metabolism.@@@@@a funnel shaped proximal portion of the ureter that is formed by convergence of the major calices [mp].@@@@@a capillary tuft which forms a close network with the visceral epithelium (podocytes) and the mesangium to form the filtration barrier and is surrounded by bowman's capsule in nephrons of the vertebrate kidney[go].@@@@@in this ontology, the renal pelvis is represented as the area of part-overlap between the kidney and the ureter@@@@@renal agenesis (ra) is a form of renal tract malformation characterized by the complete absence of development of one or both kidneys (unilateral ra or bilateral ra respectively), accompanied by absent ureter(s).@@@@@an autosomal inherited disorder due to defective reabsorption of glucose by the proximal renal tubules. the urinary loss of glucose can reach beyond 50 g/day. it is attributed to the mutations in the sodium-glucose transporter 2 encoded by the slc5a2 gene.@@@@@the renal system in an anatomical system that maintains fluid balance and contributes to electrolyte balance, acid/base balance, and disposal of nitrogenous waste products.@@@@@a final common manifestation of a wide variety of chronic kidney diseases characterized by glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.@@@@@a leiomyoma that involves the kidney.@@@@@one of two laterally paired arteries that supplies the kidneys. these are large arteries that branch from the dorsal aorta in primitive vertebrates.@@@@@a group of inherited kidney disorders characterized by the abnormally elevated levels of amino acids in urine. genetic mutations of transport proteins result in the defective reabsorption of free amino acids at the proximal renal tubules. renal aminoaciduria are classified by the specific amino acid or acids involved.@@@@@"	renal failure@@@@@hereditary urogenital adysplasia@@@@@renal glomeruli@@@@@post-renal renal failure (disorder)@@@@@pyelum@@@@@kidney pain@@@@@systema urinarium@@@@@renal fibrosis@@@@@urinary system@@@@@renal/urinary system@@@@@renal pyramids set@@@@@aminoaciduria, renal@@@@@medulla of kidney@@@@@renal aplasia@@@@@sglt2 deficiency@@@@@renal colic@@@@@colic renal@@@@@malphigian glomerulus@@@@@amyloidosis of the kidney@@@@@renal hypodysplasia/aplasia@@@@@systema urinaria@@@@@renal denervation@@@@@urinary tract@@@@@kidney pelvis@@@@@glomerulus renis@@@@@renal arteries@@@@@pelvis of ureter@@@@@leiomyoma of kidney@@@@@hereditary renal aplasia@@@@@ectopia renis@@@@@ectopic kidney@@@@@nephritic colic@@@@@renal aminoaciduria@@@@@p. renallis@@@@@absent/small kidney@@@@@renal aminoacidurias@@@@@medulla renalis@@@@@renal scarring@@@@@renal agenesis/hypoplasia@@@@@kidney leiomyoma@@@@@kidney fibrosis@@@@@pyramides renales@@@@@kidney medulla@@@@@glomerular tuft@@@@@renal pain@@@@@malpighian glomerulus@@@@@renal or urinary system@@@@@renal interstitial@@@@@renal leiomyoma@@@@@renal corpuscle@@@@@malpighian tuft@@@@@renal agenesis@@@@@renal medullae@@@@@inborn renal aminoaciduria@@@@@glomerular capillary tuft@@@@@renal diabetes@@@@@excretory system@@@@@renal adysplasia@@@@@renal perfusion@@@@@renal ectopy@@@@@renal failure in adulthood@@@@@absent/underdeveloped kidney@@@@@glomerulus@@@@@renal amyloidosis@@@@@familial renal glucosuria@@@@@renal pyramids@@@@@renal insufficiency@@@@@arteria renalis@@@@@kidney amyloidosis@@@@@renal agenesis (disease)@@@@@renal arterial tree@@@@@glycosuria, renal@@@@@renal medullae set@@@@@renal sympathetic denervation@@@@@medullary pyramids@@@@@renal@@@@@pain kidney@@@@@renal ectopia@@@@@renal marrow@@@@@

chronic increase in blood pressure, which may lead to a variety of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and renal disease. hypertension risk factors include obesity, alcohol, smoking, kidney or endocrine diseases, diabetes mellitus, and family history. postmenopause is also frequently associated with arterial hypertension.    signaling description: the hypertension risk related to postmenopause is due to rapid reduction of estrogen levels, which has a direct effect on blood vessel functions. estrogens influence the transcription of a number of genes. once activated by estrogen, the esr1 is translocated into the nucleus where it interacts with transcription factors including ncoa1/2/3 and ep300 to form a transcription complex to induce the expression of downstream target genes. in addition, rapid non-genomic effects are mediated by esr1 and gper. the loss of estrogens contributes to endothelial dysfunction and results in arterial hypertension. endothelial dysfunction is typically characterized by a reduction in nitric oxide (no) levels. estradiol quickly stimulates no production by increasing intracellular ca2+ which activates nos3 and in the long-term by upregulating the transcription of nos3. both acute and chronic effects of estradiol on no promote vasodilation. cav1 and cav3 are the primary structural proteins of caveolae, which are vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane that represent specialized membrane signaling organelles. they are the preferential site of esr1 signaling complexes in endothelial cells. activated esr1 co-localizes with cav1/3 and activates nos3. once activated by estradiol, membrane-bound esr1 activates pik3ca via pik3r1.    outcome effects: pik3ca, through pip3 and pdpk1, activates akt1, which phosphorylates and activates nos3 and creb1, which in turn bind the nuclear esr1 transcription complex. in addition, gper, via gnaq, stimulates plcb1 and phosphatidyl-inositol-calcium second messenger system resulting in the release of ca2+ into the cytoplasm from the endoplasmic reticulum. ca2+ binds the multifunctional binding messenger protein, calmodulin, which activates nos3. cav3 inhibits adcy, which activates nos3 via pka. nuclear esr1 transcription complex promotes the expression of ptgis, ptgs2, and ptgs1, which catalyze the synthesis of prostaglandin involved in vasodilation and regulation of platelet function. in addition, nuclear esr1 transcription complex promotes the expression of blood clotting regulators such as pros1, thbd, and procr. furthermore, esr1 and gper activate map kinases cascade via src/shc1 and leads to the activation of il6, il8, ccl2, and vegfa which are involved in the mediation of vascularization.

from the breast, most commonly the terminal ductal-lobular unit. it is the most common malignant tumor in females. risk factors include country of birth, family history, menstrual and reproductive history, fibrocystic disease and epithelial hyperplasia, exogenous estrogens, contraceptive agents, and ionizing radiation. the vast majority of breast carcinomas are adenocarcinomas (ductal or lobular). breast carcinoma spreads by direct invasion, by the lymphatic route, and by the blood vessel route. the most common site of lymph node involvement is the axilla.@@@@@<h3>what is breast cancer?</h3> <p>breast cancer is a cancer that starts in breast tissue. it happens when cells in the breast change and grow out of control. the cells usually form a tumor.</p> <p>sometimes the cancer does not spread any further. this is called ""in situ."" if the cancer spreads outside the breast, the cancer is called ""invasive."" it may just spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes. or the cancer may metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) through the lymph system or the blood.</p> <p>breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women in the united states. rarely, it can also affect <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/malebreastcancer.html"">men</a>.</p> <h3>what are the types of breast cancer?</h3> <p>there are different types of breast cancer. the types are based on which breast cells turn into cancer. the types include</p> <ul> <li><strong>ductal carcinoma</strong>, which begins in the cells of the ducts. this is the most common type.</li> <li><strong>lobular carcinoma</strong>, which begins in the lobules. it is more often found in both breasts than other types of breast cancer.</li> <li><strong>inflammatory breast cancer</strong>, in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. the breast becomes warm, red, and swollen. this is a rare type.</li> <li><strong>paget's disease of the breast</strong>, which is a cancer involving the skin of the nipple. it usually also affects the darker skin around the nipple. it is also rare.</li> </ul> <h3>what causes breast cancer?</h3> <p>breast cancer happens when there are <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/breast-cancer/#causes"">changes in the genetic material</a> (dna). often, the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown.</p> <p>but sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. breast cancer that is caused by inherited genetic changes is called hereditary breast cancer.</p> <p>there are also certain genetic changes that can raise your risk of breast cancer, including changes called <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/brca1/"">brca1</a> and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/brca2/"">brca2</a>. these two changes also raise your risk of <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/ovariancancer.html"">ovarian</a> and other cancers.</p> <p>besides genetics, your lifestyle and the environment can affect your risk of breast cancer.</p> <h3>who is at risk for breast cancer?</h3> <p>the factors which raise your risk of breast cancer include</p> <ul> <li>older age</li> <li>history of breast cancer or benign (noncancer) breast disease</li> <li>inherited risk of breast cancer, including having brca1 and brca2 gene changes</li> <li>dense breast tissue</li> <li>a reproductive history that leads to more exposure to the estrogen hormone, including <ul> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/menstruation.html"">menstruating</a> at an early age</li> <li>being at an older age when you first gave birth or never having given birth</li> <li>starting <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/menopause.html"">menopause</a> at a later

href=""https://medlineplus.gov/alcohol.html"">alcohol</a></li> </ul> <h3>what are the signs and symptoms of breast cancer?</h3> <p>the signs and symptoms of breast cancer include</p> <ul> <li>a new lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the armpit</li> <li>a change in the size or shape of the breast</li> <li>a dimple or puckering in the skin of the breast. it may look like the skin of an orange.</li> <li>a nipple turned inward into the breast</li> <li>nipple discharge other than breast milk. the discharge might happen suddenly, be bloody, or happen in only one breast.</li> <li>scaly, red, or swollen skin in the nipple area or the breast</li> <li>pain in any area of the breast</li> </ul> <h3>how is breast cancer diagnosed?</h3> <p>your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose breast cancer and figure out which type you have:</p> <ul> <li>a physical exam, including a clinical breast exam (cbe). this involves checking for any lumps or anything else that seems unusual with the breasts and armpits.</li> <li>a medical history</li> <li>imaging tests, such as a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/mammography.html"">mammogram</a>, an <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/sonogram/"">ultrasound</a>, or an <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/mriscans.html"">mri</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/breast-biopsy/"">breast biopsy</a></li> <li>blood chemistry tests, which measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. some of the specific blood chemistry tests include a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/basic-metabolic-panel-bmp/"">basic metabolic panel (bmp)</a>, a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-cmp/"">comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp)</a>, and an <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/electrolyte-panel/"">electrolyte panel</a>.</li> </ul> <p>if these tests show that you have breast cancer, you will have tests which study the cancer cells. these tests help your provider decide which treatment would be best for you. the tests may include</p> <ul> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/genetictesting.html"">genetic tests</a> for genetic changes such as <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/brca-test/"">brca</a> and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/tp53-genetic-test/"">tp53</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/her2-breast-cancer-testing/"">her2 test</a>. her2 is a protein involved with cell growth. it is on the outside of all breast cells. if your breast cancer cells have more her2 than normal, they can grow more quickly and spread to other parts of the body.</li> <li>an estrogen and progesterone receptor test. this test measures the amount of estrogen and progesterone (<a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/hormones.html"">hormones</a>) receptors in cancer tissue. if there are more receptors than normal, the cancer is called estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive. this type of breast cancer may grow more quickly.</li> </ul> <p>another step is staging the cancer. staging involves doing tests to find out whether the cancer has spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. the tests may include other <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/diagnosticimaging.html"">diagnostic imaging tests</a> and a sentinel lymph node biopsy. this biopsy is done to see whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.</p> <h3>what are the treatments for breast cancer?</h3> <p>treatments for breast cancer include</p> <ul> <li>surgery such as <ul> <li>a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/mastectomy.html"">mastectomy</a>, which removes the whole breast</li> <li>a lumpectomy to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself</li> </ul> </li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/radiationtherapy.html"">radiation therapy</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/cancerchemotherapy.html"">chemotherapy</a></li> <li>hormone therapy, which blocks cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow</li> <li>targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/cancerimmunotherapy.html"">immunotherapy</a></li> </ul> <h3>can breast cancer be prevented?</h3> <p>you may be able to help prevent breast cancer by making healthy lifestyle changes such as</p> <ul> <li>staying at a healthy weight</li> <li>limiting alcohol use</li> <li>getting <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/howmuchexercisedoineed.html"">enough exercise</a>e</li> <li>limiting your exposure to estrogen by <ul> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/breastfeeding.html"">breastfeeding</a> your babies if you can</li> <li>limiting hormone therapy</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>if you are at high risk, your health care provider may suggest that you take certain medicines to lower the risk. some women at very high risk may decide to get a mastectomy (of their healthy breasts) to prevent breast cancer.</p> <p>it's also important to get regular mammograms. they may be able to identify breast cancer in the early stages, when it is easier to treat.</p> <p class="""">nih: national cancer institute</p>@@@@@""a

cancer@@@@@genetic breast cancer@@@@@accessory breast carcinoma@@@@@celltype: mammary epithelial cell@@@@@notes: headnote: breast cancer (bc) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women (excluding skin cancer) and the second leading cause of cancer death in women. men may also develop bc, but this accounts for less than 1% of all bcs. one of the major molecular subtypes of bc is basal breast cancer (bbc).    signaling description: bbc has cells with features similar to those of the outer (basal) cells lining the mammary ducts. most bbcs are triple-negative breast cancers (tnbc). however, not all tnbcs are basal-like and not all bbcs are triple-negative. tnbc/bbc has estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2/neu) negative (er-, pr-, erbb2-) status. these are high-grade cancers that tend to grow quickly and have a poor prognosis. tnbc/bbc demonstrates overexpression of egfr (epidermal growth factor receptor), vegfrs (vascular endothelial growth factor receptors) including vegfr1 (flt1), vegfr2 (kdr), and vegfr3 (flt4), lrp6 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6), fzd7, kit (c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase), tnfrsf10a (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 10a), tgfbr1 (receptor 1 of transforming growth factor beta), and notch1. in addition, there may be mutations in tp53, pten (antagonist of pik3ca and suppressor of akt1-mediated signaling pathways), and in dna repair genes such as brca1, brca2, palb2, rad51, nbn, brip1, parp1, and mlh1. this type of bc is more common among women with brca1 gene mutations. hormone therapy is not effective against tnbc/bbc. this cancer is generally resistant to standard therapy, although chemotherapy may be helpful. mtor inhibitors (everolimus and temsirolimus), inhibitor of src (dasatinib), inhibitors of egfr (iressa (gefitinib), lapatinib and cetuximab), inhibitors of kdr (bevacizumab and sutent (sunitinib)), inhibitor of vegfa (bevacizumab), and inhibitors of kit (dasatinib and imatinib) are used for the treatment of bc. the crucial pathogenic processes involved in tnbc/bbc are cell proliferation, block of apoptosis, cell invasion, chromatin remodeling, dysfunction of dna repair, and loss of cell differentiation.    outcome effects: the overexpression of egfr and vegfrs causes constitutive activation of akt1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signaling cascades that result in block of apoptosis, loss of differentiation, proliferation, and migration of mammary epithelial cells. the overexpression of kit and tgfbr1 triggers the activation of janus kinases 1/2 (jak1/2) and smad family members 2/3/4 (smad2/3/4) complexes, respectively which are involved in cell proliferation. the constitutive activation of notch signaling leads to loss of differentiation and hyperplastic growth of mammary epithelial cells. the overexpression of fzd7 and lrp6 causes the constitutive activation of wnt/ctnnb1 signaling pathway resulting in loss of differentiation, redundant cell proliferation, and migration. the overexpression of tnfrsf10a over-activates nf-kb which participates in blocking apoptosis. normally, brca1 and brca2 play a central role in dna repair, response to dna damage, prevention of chromosome breaks, and genomic stability. brca1 interacts with dna mismatch repair protein complex mlh1/msh2/msh3/msh6 and genes that participate in homologous recombination and double-strand break repair such as brca2, rad51, brip1, palb2, mrn complex (rad50/mre11a/nbn), and parp1/2 via nbn. mutations in these genes lead to block of dna repair and dysfunction in response to dna damage.    highlighted proteins: proteins with increased expression or activity are highlighted in red.    mutated genes: mutated genes are shown in white-out style.@@@@@infiltrating breast cancer@@@@@""mammary neoplasm"" related []@@@@@malignant tumor of breast@@@@@""breast tumor"" exact

href=""https://medlineplus.gov/neurologicdiseases.html"">neurological conditions</a>, such as <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/multiplesclerosis.html"">multiple sclerosis</a> and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/spinalcordinjuries.html"">spinal cord injuries</a>.</li> <li><strong>overflow incontinence</strong> happens when your bladder doesn't empty all the way. this causes too much urine to stay in your bladder. your bladder gets too full, and you leak urine. this form of ui is most common in men. some of the causes include tumors, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/kidneystones.html"">kidney stones</a>, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/diabetes.html"">diabetes</a>, and certain medicines.</li> <li><strong>functional incontinence</strong> happens when a physical or mental <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/disabilities.html"">disability</a>, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/speechandcommunicationdisorders.html"">trouble speaking</a>, or some other problem keeps you from getting to the toilet in time. for example, someone with arthritis may have trouble unbuttoning his or her pants, or a person with <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/alzheimersdisease.html"">alzheimer's disease</a> may not realize they need to plan to use the toilet.</li> <li><strong>mixed incontinence</strong> means that you have more than one type of incontinence. it's usually a combination of stress and urge incontinence.</li> <li><strong>transient incontinence</strong> is urine leakage that is caused by a temporary (transient) situation such as an infection or new medicine. once the cause is removed, the incontinence goes away.</li> <li><strong>bedwetting</strong> refers to urine leakage during sleep. this is most common in children, but adults can also have it. <ul> <li>bedwetting is normal for many children. it is more common in boys. bedwetting is often not considered a health problem, especially when it runs in the family. but if it still happens often at age 5 and older, it may be because of a bladder control problem. this problem could be caused by slow physical development, an illness, making too much urine at night, or another problem. sometimes there is more than one cause.</li> <li>in adults, the causes include some medicines, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html"">caffeine</a>, and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/alcohol.html"">alcohol</a>. it can also be caused by certain health problems, such as <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/diabetesinsipidus.html"">diabetes insipidus</a>, a urinary tract infection (uti), kidney stones, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/enlargedprostatebph.html"">enlarged prostate</a> (bph), and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/sleepapnea.html"">sleep apnea</a>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>who is at risk for urinary incontinence (ui)?</h3> <p>in adults, you are at higher risk of developing ui if you</p> <ul> <li>are female, especially after going through pregnancy, childbirth, and/or menopause</li> <li>are older. as you age, your urinary tract muscles weaken, making it harder to hold in urine.</li> <li>are a man with <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/prostatediseases.html"">prostate problems</a></li> <li>have certain health problems, such as diabetes, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/obesity.html"">obesity</a>, or long-lasting <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/constipation.html"">constipation</a></li> <li>are a smoker</li> <li>have a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/birthdefects.html"">birth defect</a> that affects the structure of your urinary tract</li> </ul> <p>in children, bedwetting is more common in younger children, boys, and those whose parents wet the bed when they were children.</p> <h3>how is urinary incontinence (ui) diagnosed?</h3> <p>your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:</p> <ul> <li>a medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. your provider may ask you to keep a bladder diary for a few days before your appointment. the bladder diary includes how much and when you drink liquids, when and how much you urinate, and whether you leak urine.</li> <li>a physical exam, which can include a rectal exam. women may also get a pelvic exam.</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/urinalysis.html"">urine</a> and/or blood tests</li> <li>bladder function tests</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/diagnosticimaging.html"">imaging tests</a></li> </ul> <h3>what are the treatments for urinary incontinence (ui)?</h3> <p>treatment depends on the type and cause of your ui. you may need a combination of treatments. your provider may first suggest self-care treatments, including</p> <ul> <li><strong>lifestyle changes</strong> to reduce leaks: <ul> <li>drinking the right amount of liquid at the right time</li> <li>being physically active</li> <li>staying at a healthy weigh</li> <li>avoiding constipation</li> <li>not smoking</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>bladder training.</strong> this involves urinating according to a schedule. your provider makes a schedule from you, based on information from your bladder diary. after you adjust to the schedule, you gradually wait a little longer between trips to the bathroom. this can help stretch your bladder so it can hold more urine.</li> <li><strong>doing exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles</strong>. strong pelvic floor muscles hold in urine better than weak muscles. the strengthening exercises are called kegel exercises. they involve tightening and relaxing the muscles that control urine flow.</li> </ul> <p>if these treatments do not work, your provider may suggest other options such as</p> <ul> <li><strong>medicines</strong>, which can be used to <ul> <li>relax the bladder muscles, to help prevent bladder spasms</li> <li>block nerve signals that cause urinary frequency and urgency</li> <li>in men, shrink the prostate and improve urine flow</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>medical devices</strong>, including <ul> <li>a catheter, which is a tube to carry urine out of the body. you might use one a few times a day or all the time.</li> <li>for women, a ring or a tampon-like device inserted into the vagina. the devices pushes up against your urethra to help decrease leaks.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>bulking agents</strong>, which are injected into the bladder neck and urethra tissues to thicken them. this helps close your bladder opening so you have less leaking.</li> <li><strong>electrical nerve stimulation</strong>, which involves changing your bladder's reflexes using pulses of electricity</li> <li><strong>surgery</strong> to support the bladder in its normal position. this may be done with a sling that is attached to the pubic bone.</li> </ul> <p class="""">nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases</p>@@@@@inability to control the urinary excretory functions@@@@@loss of the ability to
