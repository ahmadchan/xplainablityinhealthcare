DEVELOPMENT PART:

Identify and fetch Entity(Sushama) - done. list of extracted entities is being returned.
Codiesp dataset upload(Raihana) - .tsv file generated. Need to uplaod in github
Fetch Hierarchy list for each Entity(Sushama) - done. hierarchy information saved in sqlite3 db
KG creation for concepts\entities(Mutahira) - 99% done, filtration in-progress
KG visualization(Mutahira) - almost done
Connection creation among entities using word embedding (Raihana, Mutahira) - pending to add to nodes of KG
Connection creation among entities using word embedding-->Divided into 2 parts, Cluster-based comparsion (70% done, filteration in progress), Node-based Comparison.
UI design(Aisha) - in-progress, it will be updated based on KG creation
BE and UI integration (Raihana) - can start with structured data, Unstructured data can also be integrated and tested
Condition to combine two or more knowledge graphs(Mutahira)


EXISTING BUGS:
KG generation fails for terminology like fever, high fever (1% exception is present on generic terms, will add a user guide in UI to demostrate how to deal with these kind of issues)

TESTING:
1. test KG generation (Sushama): Tested for 5 medical concepts - it was successful for three.
2. test medical entity extraction - does it leave out any important term?

TEST WITH SPECIFIC USECASES:

DRAFTING OF PAPER:
Points to cover in paper:
1. KG creation is a big issue and medical KG creation is a bigger one.
2. Methodologies are presented in previous years but an web application having runtime KG creation is not proposed.
3. This application will work with 99% automation and can be applied to mutiple use-cases.
4. Pipeline to discuss. It took multiple steps and tools to implement.
5. Apply to some use-case to have evaluation.
