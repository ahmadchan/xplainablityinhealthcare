Here, we are exploring something in Codiesp Dataset--> https://zenodo.org/record/3837305#.XsZFoXUzZpg
1. We found that majority of codes belong to Chapter II of ICD-10 Hierarchy.
2. And, majority of codes belong to D10-D36 section of chapter II.
3. We analysed this dataset because, we may fine-tune embedding models.

The ICD-10 Chapters are:
The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), is a comprehensive coding system used for classifying diseases and other health conditions. It consists of multiple volumes and chapters that categorize various diseases and conditions.

ICD-10 is organized into two main volumes:

ICD-10 Volume 1: Tabular List of Diseases and Injuries (also known as the Tabular List) - This volume contains the codes and guidelines for diseases and injuries. It is divided into chapters based on different body systems and categories of diseases.

ICD-10 Volume 2: Instruction Manual (also known as the Index) - This volume provides instructions and conventions for using the ICD-10 coding system, including index references, coding rules, and guidelines.

The Tabular List (Volume 1) of ICD-10 consists of 22 chapters that cover a wide range of diseases, conditions, and external causes. The chapters in ICD-10 are as follows:

1. Certain infectious and parasitic diseases
2. Neoplasms (tumors)
3. Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs
4. Endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases
5. Mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders
6. Diseases of the nervous system
7. Diseases of the eye and adnexa
8. Diseases of the ear and mastoid process
9. Diseases of the circulatory system
10. Diseases of the respiratory system
11. Diseases of the digestive system
12. Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue
13. Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue
14. Diseases of the genitourinary system
15. Pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium
16. Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period
17. Congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities
18. Symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings
19. Injury, poisoning, and certain other consequences of external causes
20. External causes of morbidity and mortality
21. Factors influencing health status and contact with health services
22. Codes for special purposes

Each chapter in the ICD-10 coding system focuses on a specific set of diseases or conditions. It's important to refer to the official documentation or resources to get detailed information on each chapter and the corresponding codes within them.

Chapter II subsections are:
Chapter 2 of the ICD-10 coding system is titled "Neoplasms." This chapter focuses on the classification and coding of tumors, which are abnormal growths of cells. Neoplasms can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

ICD-10 Chapter 2 further divides neoplasms into several sections based on the anatomical site and type of tumor. These sections include:

C00-C14: Malignant neoplasms of lip, oral cavity, and pharynx
C15-C26: Malignant neoplasms of the digestive organs and peritoneum
C30-C39: Malignant neoplasms of respiratory and intrathoracic organs
C40-C41: Malignant neoplasms of bone and articular cartilage
C43-C44: Melanoma and other malignant neoplasms of skin
C45-C49: Malignant neoplasms of mesothelial and soft tissue
C50-C50: Malignant neoplasms of breast
C51-C58: Malignant neoplasms of female genital organs
C60-C63: Malignant neoplasms of male genital organs
C64-C68: Malignant neoplasms of urinary tract
C69-C72: Malignant neoplasms of eye, brain, and other parts of the central nervous system
C73-C75: Malignant neoplasms of thyroid and other endocrine glands
C76-C80: Malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary, and unspecified sites
C81-C96: Malignant neoplasms of lymphoid, hematopoietic, and related tissue
Each section within Chapter 2 contains more specific categories that classify different types of neoplasms based on their location and characteristics. These categories are further broken down into codes that allow healthcare professionals to accurately identify and record specific types of tumors.

It's important to note that Chapter 2 provides guidelines and codes for malignant neoplasms only. Benign tumors are classified in other chapters of the ICD-10 coding system.
